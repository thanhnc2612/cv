    <h1>More about me</h1>
    3 words to introduce me: Smart, funny, honest.<br>
    <p>
      I'm very interested in software engineer, I'm curious about how computer works, how to make an app,
      how the data transfer on the internet and all about programing.
      Beside I'm controling the production at the factory, I also learn about programing by myself.
      I really enjoy the moment I'm writing some codes and see the result. But enthusiastic is not enough for me to get a job
      in this field. I have no programing background and I'm 28 now. Anyways, I still love it and maybe some day I will become
      a developer.
